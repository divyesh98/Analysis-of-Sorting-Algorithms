# Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithms
A program to compare different types of sorting algorithms to check which algorithm takes longer time for completion.

Programs are written in two different languages, one is python and the other is c++. In the c++ code, we compare the sorting algorithms for a single array arranged in descending order to sort it in ascending order. The array is of length 50000.
